# FW modification instructions

this repo is a fork of the keebart one. Make sure you enable github actions to build the FW.

use this online editor https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/ to edit keymaps

after you finish the edits you can commit them and run the FW build in github actions.

once the action is completed click it to see the "firmware" folder download. It will have a bunch of uf2 files, choose the one named `nice_view-corne_choc_pro_left-zmk.uf2`

plug in the left side corne and 2x press the reset hole with a sim-card stick. A drive called KEEBART will be there. Then delete the old stuff, andu upload the new file from above.
